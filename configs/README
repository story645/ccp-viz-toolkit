Place all the config files for any data you want on the web. Any files
with a .cfg extension and a data section will be parsed, so be careful
with experimental configs. It's recommended to set txtlog and create_folder
to off when creating a web app.


The config file has three sections, data, spatial_graph, and
temporal_graph. 

data:
There are two required parameters: 
name = name of the data as it should appear in the drop down menu
file_path = the absolute path to the data on the host system
data also accepts any keyword argument supported by
ccpdata/fromNetCDF.

spatial_graph
All the parameters are optional and based on the kwargs for
SpatialGraph and CCPGraph, but projection is required for maps to show up in the
final visualization.

temporal_graph
All the parameters are optional and based on the kwargs for
TemporalGraph and CCPGraph.
